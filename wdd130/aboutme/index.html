    <p>Hello, everyone. It is with great honor to be a member of the class.</p>
    <p>I would love to be a frontend developer after this study. So I am glad I am in the right place</p>
    <p>My main hobbies are making research on the internet, recording podcasts with my best friends and also playing football or soccer as you would call it.</p>
